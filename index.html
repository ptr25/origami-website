        <h1><i><b>Origami</b></i></h1>
        <h2><i>Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori(“folding”) and kami (“paper”).Traditional origami consists of folding a single  sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.</i></h2>

        <p><b>1. Start with your paper
            white side up.
            Fold in half, open, then fold
            in half the other way</b></p>
        <p><b>2. Now Fold the Paper in
            half diagonally, both
            ways.</b></p>
        <p><b>3. Fold all four corners into
            the centre and crease well</b></p>
        <p><b>4. Turn Over and Fold all four
            corners into the centre again.</b></p>
        <p><b>5. Your creases should look
            like this. It looks complicated,
            but dont worry</b></p>
        <p><b>6. Fold the outside edges into
            the centre line</b></p>
        <p><b>7. Holding each inside edge from the point at the
            centre, bring these edges out to the points shown.
            Then, fold the top edge downwards and flatten </b></p>
        <p><b>8. Rotate the model, and repeat step 7.</b></p>
        <p><b>9. Fold the top half
            backwards and flatten</b></p>
        <p><b>10. Fold down the
            front outside corners</b></p>
        <p><b>11. Fold these
            outside corners
            inward as shown</b></p>
        <p><b>12. Fold the
            butterfly in half</b></p>
        <p><b>13. Now fold the top
            layer backwards, at the
            angle shown.</b></p>
        <p><b>14. And now fold the
            back wing backwards
            also at the same angle</b></p>
        <p><b>15. Open out. Your
            butterfly is complete!</b></p>
